"""Processing of the binary data generated on Markov.

Import binary files via pickle. 
Change format of all the binary files to csv (make new files).
Sort the csv files ascending in order of J (col 4: value of objective function in last iteration).
Possible to delete old, unsorted csv files in the end also. 

NB: The commands used via subprocess are only tested on some Linux distributions. 
Hence, we do not know if these commands work on Windows or Mac. They probably work
on Mac, but probably not on Windows.
